Nurses vs Nonsense is a game which encourages players to stop individuals from shopping in stores without masks.
By placing strategic obstacles such as: 

 * Nurses who throw masks
 * Scientists who provide more game health
 * Newspapers which temporarily stop the anti-maskers
 * Sanitizer which causes people within the immediate vicinity to leave
 
 Players are tasked with protecting the store and minimizing the spread of COVID.  JavaScript, HTML Canvas, and CSS were used to display the game and carry out the game logic.
